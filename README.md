I was given this website to refract and clean for the client. I edited the code mainly to optimize this website on search engines so it would be able to perform better and in turn load faster. Some of the code was updated to include the following:

```
-Reusable and Structured Code
-Accessible Code
-Optimized Load Times
-All Elements of the Page are Visible
-Easy to Follow Documentation
```
